# Getting started

## Pre-installation

1. Make sure you have Node installed by using the command `node -v`. The minimum node version compatible with this
lib is 13.2. If Node is not installed or is on an unsupported version, consider installing nvm in your machine. nvm is
a tool to manage node versions installed in the system, it's easier to upgrade and switch from one version to another
than a pure installation of node. To install nvm, check [this link](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). If you don't want
to install nvm, you can also download node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

2. This is optional, but we recommend using yarn instead of npm. If you choose to follow this recommendation, use the
command `npm install yarn --global`.

## Installation
