# Beagle Backend Typescript
Welcome to the Beagle Backend TS! This project implements a backend for [Beagle](todo) in Typescript. To run the
backend you'll need NodeJS. Although not tested, this should also work for any backend technology for Javascript (but
without the facilities provided by the express-client sub-project).

This repository is a mono-repo with 4 projects:
- core: the core implementation for the Beagle backend, this should work with anything that runs JS.
- components: the default components of the Beagle library. If you don't use any of these components, there's no need
to use this module.
- express: a more user-friendly interface of the core lib, it brings a lot of benefits that makes the lib easier to
use and safer (better typing). The drawback is that it only works with node-express servers.

This documentation will assume you have all three modules installed in your node application. For more information
on how to use the Beagle Backend TS without Express, check [this topic](todo).
