# Beagle Backend TypeScript | beagle-ts-cli-project-name

This is a sample application, also known as boilerplate, for Beagle Backend TypeScript.

After the installation, to run the application, please run:
```npm run start```
or, if you are using yarn:
```yarn start```

The application will start running on port `beagle-ts-cli-port`.

There are two routes available:

- `http://localhost:beagle-ts-cli-port/beagle`: Welcome page
- `http://localhost:beagle-ts-cli-port/beagle/home`: A test page to exemplify the navigation and global context.

You can modify this project as you want.
